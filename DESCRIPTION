Title: Automated analysis of high-throughput qPCR data
Version: 1.50.0
Author: Heidi Dvinge, Paul Bertone
Maintainer: Heidi Dvinge <hdvinge@fredhutch.org>
Description: Analysis of Ct values from high throughput quantitative
  real-time PCR (qPCR) assays across multiple conditions or
  replicates. The input data can be from spatially-defined
  formats such ABI TaqMan Low Density Arrays or OpenArray;
  LightCycler from Roche Applied Science; the CFX plates from
  Bio-Rad Laboratories; conventional 96- or 384-well plates; or
  microfluidic devices such as the Dynamic Arrays from Fluidigm
  Corporation. HTqPCR handles data loading, quality assessment,
  normalization, visualization and parametric or non-parametric
  testing for statistical significance in Ct values between
  features (e.g. genes, microRNAs).
