Author: Heidi Dvinge, Paul Bertone
Maintainer: Heidi Dvinge <heidi@ebi.ac.uk>
Description: Analysis of Ct values from quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays. Data can be analyzed in high throughput across multiple conditions or replicates, and in spatially-defined formats such ABI TaqMan Low Density Arrays and conventional 96- or 384-well plates. HTqPCR handles data loading, quality assessment, normalization, visualization and parametric or non-parametric testing for statistical significance in Ct values between features (e.g. genes, microRNAs).
