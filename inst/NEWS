SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Add "history" slot to qPCRset object, instead of "normalized". 
    This means all operations (filtering, normalization etc.) performed 
    on the object can be retrieved with getCtHistory.

NEW FEATURES

    o n.data parameter to readCtData in case there are results from 
    multiple cards in each file.
 
    o getCt and setCt added as accessor and replacement functions (alias 
    for exprs).

    o Add "fold change" to the output from limmaCtData and ttestCtData.

    o Add p-value adjustment to ttestCtData.

    o Expanded functionality of plotCtPCA.

    o Added function changeCtLayout for data containing multiple samples 
    per 384 well plate.

    o Added rbind and cbind functions for combining qPCRset objects.

    o Added mannwhitneyCtData for Mann-Whitney test between samples.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug in readCtData regarding file paths.

    o Added "fake" featureNames to readCtData if not present in input.

    o Gives error if no column for Ct values is specified.

    o Fix bug in ttestCtData(.., paired=TRUE) (cf Jeremy Hetzel).

    o Added sample names to flag and featureCategory in readCtData.

    o Fixed bugs in plotting functions when exprs() only has 1 column.

    o Reset "par" after using plotCtCard.

    o Fixed bug with parameter "samples" in readCtData.

    o featureCategory only required if unR=TRUE and/or unD=TRUE in 
    plotCtCard.

    o In plotCtDensity, remove samples were all values=NA.

    o The internal function panel.Ct.cor adjusted to handle NAs.

    o Remove all samples with just NA in plotCtPCA.

    o Fixed bug in ttestCtData (results always reported as "OK" not
    "Undetermined")
    o Add sampleNames to flag() and featureCategory()
