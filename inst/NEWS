BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in plotCtOverview affecting sample names starting with "M".
    o Corrected rbind so all data frames contain characters, not factors.
    o Changed a "stop" to a "warning" in readCtData.
    o Corrected qPCRset subsetting when columns are selected multiple times.
    o Added dupcor parameter to limmaCtData.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1:

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Add "history" slot to qPCRset object, instead of "normalized". 
    This means all operations (filtering, normalization etc.) performed 
    on the object can be retrieved with getCtHistory.

NEW FEATURES

    o n.data parameter to readCtData in case there are results from 
    multiple cards in each file.
     o getCt and setCt added as accessor and replacement functions (alias 
    for exprs).
    o Add "fold change" to the output from limmaCtData and ttestCtData.
    o Add p-value adjustment to ttestCtData.
    o Expanded functionality of plotCtPCA.
    o Added function changeCtLayout for data containing multiple samples 
    per 384 well plate.
    o Added rbind and cbind functions for combining qPCRset objects.
    o Added mannwhitneyCtData for Mann-Whitney test between samples.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug in readCtData regarding file paths.
    o Added "fake" featureNames to readCtData if not present in input.
    o Gives error if no column for Ct values is specified.
    o Fix bug in ttestCtData(.., paired=TRUE) (cf Jeremy Hetzel).
    o Added sample names to flag and featureCategory in readCtData.
    o Fixed bugs in plotting functions when exprs() only has 1 column.
    o Reset "par" after using plotCtCard.
    o Fixed bug with parameter "samples" in readCtData.
    o featureCategory only required if unR=TRUE and/or unD=TRUE in 
    plotCtCard.
    o In plotCtDensity, remove samples were all values=NA.
    o The internal function panel.Ct.cor adjusted to handle NAs.
    o Remove all samples with just NA in plotCtPCA.
    o Fixed bug in ttestCtData (results always reported as "OK" not
    "Undetermined")
    o Add sampleNames to flag() and featureCategory()

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0:
